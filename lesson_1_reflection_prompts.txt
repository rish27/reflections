How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

    
A.	To see the exact lines where difference was occuring saved reviewing each and every line of code, which can become practically impossible in large codebase.
   




How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

 
A.	To maintain large codebase we have to maintain each version of the file.So that changes made in between intial and later commits can be addressed if causing any issue.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
A.	Logical Changes are made to version control system like Git instead of unfit changes that might not be even safe to deploy or might create too much clutter in log history


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
